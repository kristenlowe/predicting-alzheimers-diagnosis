# Predicting Alzheimer's Diagnosis
This project predicts Alzheimer's disease based on a number of different variables using a variety of machine learning models.

## Part I: Exploratory Data Analysis
- feature engineering
- one hot encoding
- explore trends
- visualizations

## Part II: K-Nearest Neighbors

## Part III: Regression Models
- logistic regression
- lasso
- ridge regression
- stepwise

## Part IV: Tree-Based Models
- classification tree
- random forest
- bagging
- boosting

## Conclusion
The random forest performed best with a prediction accuracy of ~ 95%
